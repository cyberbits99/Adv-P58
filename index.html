        <p>My favorite hobby is reading book! I feel that when I read, I go into another universe. Most of the books I read are recommended by my friends. We read some of them in school. My favorite genre of books are fantasy, mystery, and dystopian. One of my favorite books are "Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins. I also enjoy watching movies based on my favorite books.</p>
